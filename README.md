# Modelling_Surtseyan_Ejecta_PhD_Code
The Matlab code from the thesis Modelling Sursteyan Ejecta 
This is a sample of some of the code I used in my thesis Modelling Surtseyan ejecta.
Surtseyan ejecta are magma ejecta from volcanoes that contain a mixture of water and previously ejecta material inside them.
This is one of the versions of the code used to numerically solve a model for the temperature and pressure behaviour in the system.
This version of the code includes the arctan coordinate transformed mesh. It is also set up for 800 mesh points in the magma and 200 in the inclusion.
For more context please refer to my thesis "Modelling Surtseyan Ejecta" submitted in 2020 at Victoria University of Wellington.
